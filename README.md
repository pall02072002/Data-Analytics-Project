Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Conducted end-to-end data analysis on Web Performance and Zomato restaurant datasets using Python within Jupyter Notebook.

Performed dataset preprocessing including missing-value handling, duplicate removal, feature cleanup, and normalization.

Executed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights on user engagement performance metrics and restaurant ratings distribution.

Created visualizations (bar charts, histograms, boxplots) to identify key performance patterns such as most-ordered cuisines, highly rated restaurants, page bounce factors, and customer-impacting KPIs.

Summarized findings and documented insights for data-driven decision making.
